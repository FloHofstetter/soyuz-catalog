# PR-incremental mutation gate.
#
# Runs mutmut only on the services/ + storage/ + pagination.py modules a
# change actually touches, and fails if any of them introduces a surviving
# mutant that is not on the known-equivalent allowlist. This keeps the
# gate's wall-clock bounded (one stats pass + only the changed modules'
# mutants) while still catching "added logic, forgot the test that pins
# it" at the exact spot it is introduced.
#
# The full sweep is the nightly job (.github/workflows/mutation-nightly.yml);
# this is the cheap per-PR predecessor, the same shape as the spec-drift /
# client-drift gates.
#
# Env:
#   MUTATION_BASE_REF   git ref to diff against (default: origin/main).
#                       CI sets it to the PR base; locally it defaults to
#                       origin/main.
#
# Not wired into pre-commit on purpose — even a scoped run is minutes,
# far too slow for a commit hook.
